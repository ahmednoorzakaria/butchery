# Sales Management Backend Optimization Guide

## N+1 Query Problem Analysis

The original sales management backend was experiencing N+1 query problems, which occur when the application makes one initial query to fetch a list of records, then makes additional queries for each record to fetch related data. This creates a performance bottleneck that scales poorly with data size.

## Identified N+1 Query Issues

### 1. `/sales` Endpoint
**Problem**: Multiple separate queries for customer, items, and user data
**Solution**: Single optimized query with proper includes

### 2. `/reports/top-products` Endpoint
**Problem**: Separate query for each item name
**Solution**: Single raw SQL query with JOINs

### 3. `/reports/inventory-usage` Endpoint
**Problem**: Separate query for each item
**Solution**: Single raw SQL query with LEFT JOIN

### 4. `/reports/user-performance` Endpoint
**Problem**: Separate query for each user
**Solution**: Single raw SQL query with LEFT JOIN

### 5. Various Report Endpoints
**Problem**: Multiple separate queries for related data
**Solution**: Single queries with comprehensive includes, then process data in memory

## Optimization Strategies Applied

### 1. Proper Prisma Includes
Instead of making separate queries, use Prisma's `include` and `select` to fetch all related data in a single query:

```typescript
// Before (N+1 queries)
const sales = await prisma.sale.findMany();
for (const sale of sales) {
  const customer = await prisma.customer.findUnique({ where: { id: sale.customerId } });
  const items = await prisma.saleItem.findMany({ where: { saleId: sale.id } });
  // ... more queries
}

// After (Single optimized query)
const sales = await prisma.sale.findMany({
  include: {
    customer: {
      select: {
        id: true,
        name: true,
        phone: true,
      }
    },
    items: { 
      include: { 
        item: {
          select: {
            id: true,
            name: true,
            category: true,
            unit: true,
          }
        } 
      } 
    },
    user: { 
      select: { 
        id: true, 
        name: true 
      } 
    },
  },
});
```

### 2. Raw SQL Queries for Complex Aggregations
For complex reports that require aggregations across multiple tables, use raw SQL queries with proper JOINs:

```typescript
// Before (Multiple queries)
const items = await prisma.saleItem.groupBy({
  by: ["itemId"],
  _sum: { quantity: true },
});
const withNames = await Promise.all(
  items.map(async (item) => {
    const itemInfo = await prisma.inventoryItem.findUnique({
      where: { id: item.itemId },
    });
    return { itemId: item.itemId, name: itemInfo?.name, quantitySold: item._sum.quantity };
  })
);

// After (Single optimized query)
const topProducts = await prisma.$queryRaw<Array<{
  itemId: number;
  name: string;
  quantitySold: number;
}>>`
  SELECT 
    si."itemId",
    ii.name,
    SUM(si.quantity) as "quantitySold"
  FROM "SaleItem" si
  JOIN "Sale" s ON si."saleId" = s.id
  JOIN "InventoryItem" ii ON si."itemId" = ii.id
  WHERE s."createdAt" >= ${startDate} AND s."createdAt" <= ${endDate}
  GROUP BY si."itemId", ii.name
  ORDER BY "quantitySold" DESC
  LIMIT 10
`;
```

### 3. In-Memory Data Processing
For complex reports that require multiple aggregations, fetch all data in a single query and process it in memory:

```typescript
// Single query to fetch all necessary data
const sales = await prisma.sale.findMany({
  where: { createdAt: { gte: startDate, lte: endDate } },
  include: {
    items: { include: { item: true } },
    customer: true,
    user: true,
  },
});

// Process data in memory (much faster than multiple DB queries)
const groupedSales: Record<string, any> = {};
sales.forEach((sale) => {
  // Process each sale and aggregate data
  // This is much faster than making separate queries for each sale
});
```

### 4. Parallel Queries with Promise.all
For independent queries that can run in parallel:

```typescript
// Before (Sequential queries)
const totalCount = await prisma.sale.count({ where: { ... } });
const sales = await prisma.sale.findMany({ where: { ... } });

// After (Parallel queries)
const [totalCount, sales] = await Promise.all([
  prisma.sale.count({ where: { ... } }),
  prisma.sale.findMany({ where: { ... } })
]);
```

## Performance Improvements

### Before Optimization
- **Sales List**: 1 + N queries (where N = number of sales)
- **Top Products Report**: 1 + N queries (where N = number of items)
- **User Performance Report**: 1 + N queries (where N = number of users)
- **Customer Analysis**: 1 + N queries (where N = number of customers)

### After Optimization
- **Sales List**: 2 queries (count + data with includes)
- **Top Products Report**: 1 query (raw SQL with JOINs)
- **User Performance Report**: 1 query (raw SQL with LEFT JOIN)
- **Customer Analysis**: 1 query (with comprehensive includes)

## Expected Performance Gains

1. **Query Count Reduction**: 90%+ reduction in database queries
2. **Response Time**: 70-80% faster response times
3. **Database Load**: Significantly reduced database server load
4. **Scalability**: Better performance as data grows

## Implementation Notes

1. **Memory Usage**: In-memory processing increases memory usage but is much faster than multiple DB round trips
2. **Data Freshness**: All optimizations maintain data consistency and freshness
3. **Error Handling**: Proper error handling maintained in all optimized endpoints
4. **Type Safety**: TypeScript types preserved for all optimized queries

## Monitoring and Maintenance

1. **Query Logging**: Enable Prisma query logging in development to monitor query performance
2. **Database Indexes**: Ensure proper indexes exist on frequently queried columns
3. **Regular Review**: Periodically review query performance as data grows
4. **Caching**: Consider implementing Redis caching for frequently accessed reports
